# Express Take Home Task

In this project youâ€™ll be creating a REST API using Express. We have already started the project, some of the code and written the tests for you. Complete the tests and submit your code.  

## Task

Your task is to finish this simplified Star Wars API. Use [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) as your source data.  

Fetch the information live from the SWAPI API and transform the response to the expected response by the tests. 

You have one week to complete the task.  

You can use any NPM packages to help in the assignment.
